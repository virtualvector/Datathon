Procedure/Approach

1. We first converted all the pdf's corresponding to all districts and created
corredsponging text files for each using pdfMiner in python

2.Once we had text versions of the pdf's we parsed each file and converted it as key value pairs , and automated the
process of selecting corresponding attributes and created a dataframe in pandas.

3. we finally wrote everything to a csv file as required.
